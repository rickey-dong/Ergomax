webcam works on my laptop but not on desktop
    is it because it's a USB wired camera?
    or is it because WSL is being finicky?

theoretically fps*seconds should = frames,
    so for example if something were 30 fps
    and snapshots every 4 seconds, it would
    snapshot every 120 frames.
    but my test run snapshotted did do every 120
    frames but these 120 frames passed by in like 10
    seconds even though i set seconds variable to 4.
